# "Accuracy" of Similarity
Want similar $\equiv$
- evolutionarily -- $\alpha$ "closer" in phylogenetic tree
	- e.g. two varieties of _C. difficile_ _very close_, _Acinetobacter baumanii, johnsonii_ less so, tree and pig even less
	__=> _YAES_, when plot each sequence in latent space, _colour by empirical(?) phylogenetic classification___

# Areas to Improve
- Currently, naive sequence-based approach learns star-shaped phylogeny for *all* families of proteins
	^-- compare AlphaFold predictions, in addition to sequences, when "determining" protein similarity
